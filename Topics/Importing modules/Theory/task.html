<h2>Importing modules</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>There are different ways to interact with code. In this topic, we'll learn what they are and when an option is the most appropriate. However, most importantly, we'll find out how to save our code into a file for further use or editing. As you probably have already guessed, that applies to any code, which means you can also use someone else's code, and this last part is a pretty big deal you'll quickly appreciate as a developer.</p><h5 id="module-basics">Module basics</h5><p>While working on simple examples, you probably type your code directly into the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The interpreter in Python is a layer of software logic that executes your code, translating it line by line. | It's part of the standard Python installation package. When you write larger programs, it's more efficient to prepare your code in advance using a text editor and then run it with the interpreter. A file containing a list of operations that will be read and interpreted further on is called a script. The interpreter is responsible for translating your code into a form that the hardware can understand and execute.">interpreter</a>. But every time you exit the interpreter and start it again, you lose all the definitions you made before. So as you start writing larger programs, it makes sense to prepare your code in advance using a text editor and then run it with the interpreter. A file containing a list of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/33696" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operation in Python refers to a process that manipulates one or more values, also known as operands, using an operator. | Python supports various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. These operations can be combined in more complex expressions, and their priority is determined by Python's order of operations. Additionally, Python provides other useful operations like calculating the remainder of a division.">operations</a> that will be read and interpreted further on is called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6057" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A script in Python is a file containing a series of operations that will be read and interpreted further on. | It is typically prepared in advance using a text editor and then run with the interpreter. The primary purpose of a script is to help organize and reuse code, making it easier to structure and read. When a script is executed directly, it is often called a simple module. The distinction between a module and a script in Python lies in their usage, not in their inherent nature.">script</a></strong>.</p><p>You may also want to write some functions and then use them in other programs or even reuse code someone else wrote before. One way is just to copy the code into your program, but it soon leads to code that is badly structured and hard to read. Luckily, there is another way in Python to organize and reuse code called <strong>modules</strong>.</p><p>A module is simply a file that contains Python <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5926" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A statement in Python is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a simple statement like an assignment or a complex statement like a function or class definition. Statements are executed sequentially, and each statement can affect the program's state. Python has various types of statements, including control flow statements, which alter the flow of execution, and data manipulation statements, which perform operations on data. Comments are not considered statements, as they are ignored by the Python interpreter.">statements</a> and definitions. It usually has a <strong>.py</strong> extension. What really makes the module system powerful is the ability to <strong>load</strong> or <strong>import</strong> one module from another.</p><h5 id="module-loading">Module loading</h5><p>To load a module, just use an <strong>import </strong>statement. In its basic form, it has the following syntax: <code class="language-python">import module</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-python">import super_module

super_module.super_function()  # calling a function defined in super_module

print(super_module.super_variable)  # accessing a variable defined in super_module</code></pre><p><code class="language-python">super_module</code> is the name of the module you want to import. For example, a file called super_module.py has a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a name is a unique identifier given to a variable, function, or any other object. | It's essentially a label that distinguishes one object from another in the same scope. This concept is not unique to Python, as most programming languages have some form of naming system for their entities. However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">name</a> super_module. In order to be available for import, super_module.py should be located in the same directory as the file you are trying to import <code class="language-python">super_module</code> to. At first, Python importing system looks for a module in the current <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11119" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a directory is referred to as a package or module. | It is a way to organize and reuse code by storing related files (modules) together in a single location. When a directory is turned into a package or module, it can be imported and used in other Python scripts or modules.">directory</a>, then it checks the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12651" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A built-in module in Python is a module that is included in the Python Standard Library, meaning it comes pre-installed with Python and does not require any additional installation. | It can be used directly in the code without needing to import it. An example of a built-in module is the `statistics` module, which contains several functions for data statistics and has descriptions in the doc. The documentation for a built-in module is generated using the `sphinx` module, which extracts information from docstrings and comments in the code.">built-in modules</a>, and if nothing is found an error will be raised. After importing, the module becomes available under its name and you can access <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller and manageable tasks, making the code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">functions</a> and variables defined in it using the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15061" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dot notation in Python is a way to access the attributes and methods of an object. | It involves using a period (.) to separate the object from the attribute or method you want to access. This allows you to interact with and manipulate the object in various ways, depending on the specific attributes and methods it has. Dot notation is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming in Python, as it enables you to work with objects and their properties in a clear and concise way.">dot notation</a> (<code class="language-python">super_module.super_function()</code>).</p><p>It's also common to only import the required functions or variables from a module but not the module itself. You can do this by using <code class="language-python">from</code> in the import statement.</p><pre><code class="language-python">from super_module import super_function

super_function()  # super_function is now available directly at the current module

super_module.super_function()  # note that in this case name super_module is not imported, 
                               # so this line leads to an error</code></pre><p>A good practice is to load a single module in a single line and put all your imports at the top of the file because it increases readability.</p><pre><code class="language-python">import module1
import module2
import module3

# the rest of module code goes here</code></pre><p>A special form of import statement allows you to load all the names defined in a module. It is called <strong><em><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6384" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The wildcard import in Python is a way to import all the public objects (functions, classes, variables) defined in a module into the current namespace using the syntax 'from module_name import \*'. | However, it's generally discouraged to use this form of import since it can lead to unexpected behavior and naming conflicts. It's better to explicitly import the objects you need to avoid any ambiguity.">wildcard import</a></em></strong><em> </em>and has the syntax <code class="language-python">from module import *</code>. You should generally avoid this in your code. It can cause unexpected behavior because you don't know what names exactly are imported into the current namespace. Besides, these names may shadow some of the existing ones without your knowledge. It's better to make it explicit and specify what you're importing.</p><p>In case you have to use several import statements, pay attention to their order:</p><ol><li><p>standard <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11338" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A library in Python is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks or functions. | It is a reusable piece of software that can be utilized in various Python programs to save time and effort.
