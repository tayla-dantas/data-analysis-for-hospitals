<h2>Addition with condition</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>When we add an array and a list together, the list is also treated as an array. However, we might not want the addition of a list and an array to yield the same result as the addition of two arrays. This is because if a list is used instead of an array, it could be due to a mistake.</p><p>Complete the <code class="java">custom_sum()</code> function that takes two arguments. The two arguments can only be of the following types:</p><ol><li><p>Two arrays</p></li><li><p>An array and a list</p></li><li><p>Two lists</p></li></ol><p>In the first case, sum them and return the result. In the second case, return a string with the warning <code class="java">One argument is a list</code>, and in the last case, return <code class="java">Both arguments are lists, not arrays</code>.</p><p>All lists and arrays will be one-dimensional and of the same size. Note that you don't have to use any <code class="java">print()</code> statements in this task.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can check the variable type by calling <code class="java">isinstance(arg, type)</code>, which will return a boolean indicating whether the <code class="java">arg</code> has the specified <code class="java">type</code>. You can also use the <code class="java">type()</code> for type checking as mentioned in theory.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
