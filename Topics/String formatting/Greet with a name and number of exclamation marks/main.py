# The Python built-in function 'input' is used to read a line of text from standard input.

# First we need to take the name as string from user input
name = input()

# Now, we need to take an integer representing the number of exclamation marks
num = int(input())
exclamation = '!' * num
# TODO: Now you need to print the greeting message using the name and the number of exclamation marks. 
# You need to use the String formatting techniques here. There are several ways to format strings in python, choose the one you are most comfortable with.
print(f'Hello, {name}{exclamation}' )
