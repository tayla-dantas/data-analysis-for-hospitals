<p>You are working with a DataFrame, <code class="java">df_rock</code>, that contains sonar signals from two object classes: rocks and mines. In the first five columns, you can see the wavelengths that the sonar received from different angles.</p>
<p>Load the given data as a DataFrame, then calculate the median of the <code class="java">null_deg</code> column for rock <code class="java">"R"</code> and for mine <code class="java">"M"</code> objects separately. Below you can see the output sample. Remember to round your answer up to three decimal places.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Please, check the format of your answer, it must be "M = value R = value".</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">,null_deg,sixty_deg,ninety_deg,straight_angle,twoforty_deg,labels<br>0,0.740204,0.981484,0.605161,0.67712,0.927914,M<br>1,0.788051,0.68378,0.504151,0.713523,0.690165,M<br>2,0.744574,0.668011,0.564707,0.804288,0.713663,R<br>3,0.560475,0.487072,0.103085,0.668011,0.805988,R<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">M = 0.764 R = 0.653</code></pre><br><br>
